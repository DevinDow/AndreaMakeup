					I started playing with makeup when I was in grade school. <br />
					I was an actor, director and dancer and I realized how putting <br />
					on makeup helped to create the character I was trying to become.<br />
					Through the years I continued to learn the craft through trial <br />
					and error, mostly in the arena of theater, and getting friends <br />
					ready for special events.<br/><br/>

					After going to University and realizing that I would be happy doing <br />
					makeup for the rest of my life, I attended The Studio Makeup Academy <br />
					in Hollywood and received my Master Makeup Artist Certification in <br />
					Beauty and Special Effects.  I later returned to take a course in air <br />
					brush technique. I spent much of the years following school in the film <br />
					and television field.<br /><br/>

					I spent a few years transitioning from film to print, which is the area <br />
					I work in most today.  I have worked with some wonderful photographers, <br />
					been published in a number of magazines, and continue to grow and learn <br />
					something each day.<br><br>

					I still love how makeup can create a character, taking the quiet, timid,<br />
					sometimes even plain-looking girl who walks into the room in the <br />
					morning and transforming her into an energetic, fearless, beautiful <br />
					model, ready to pose and strut her stuff for the camera.  It really <br />
					is an amazing job, and I love doing it.
